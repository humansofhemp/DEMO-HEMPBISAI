# Build output - only if not using multi-stage builds where it's copied from a previous stage
# If your Dockerfile copies from a build stage, 'dist' should not be here.
# In our case, 'dist' is generated within the 'builder' stage and copied to the final stage,
# so it's not part of the initial context copy if COPY . . happens before the build.
# However, to be safe and explicit, especially if the COPY . . were to include it before build,
# it's often listed. For our current Dockerfile, it's not strictly necessary for 'dist'.
